# Jewish Excuse Generator
A fake holiday generator for when you don't want to attend some goyishe narishkeit but it falls out on chol. Provides the transliteration of today's Hebrew date followed by a plausible reason that that day has religious significance. 

(Thank you to Adam Scherlis for the idea!)
